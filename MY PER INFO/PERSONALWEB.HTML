	<h4> ABOUT ME </h4>
	<p> I am a beginner at coding, I really enjoy it, and I would love to 
	learn more about it and become a Front-End Developer.
	I´ve studied a BA in Political Science, and have a MA
    in International Organizations and Institutions. 
    I have been working most of my life for airlines at the different positions
    most of them at the <em>customer service area.</em>
	Just decided to make a transition in my life  due I really believe
	that with time we just get stuck and we loss creativity, imagination and we get bored so we need
	to keep alive our mind with new skills just for the fun of keep learning.
	Since technology is part of our daily future life we do need daily goals and challenges and seems 
	coding is a good path.
	Have to add that traveling, cake  decoration, concerts are my passsion.
	Well have to add that I enjoy a lot watching sports and listening heavy metal music.
	I do believe <em><b>life</em></b> should be simple, easy and free.</p>
